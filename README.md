# Nikolas Mazur Resume
## Project
This project was not only practice for flexbox and other more advanced CSS but also serves as a good area to showcase my future projects. For this reason it's very likely that this project will continue to undergo changes on a frequent basis. At the moment the site is using a fair amount of placeholder images, this is primarily due to the fact that it's an early project that requires multiple projects to the be fully complete.

As of now site is functional, but with a few changes that are planned; namely shoring up the design to be more visually appealing, seeing as monochromatic designs can turn into visual mush.

## Challenges and Lessons Larned
Throught this project I had to do constant research on the documentation for CSS flexboxes as I'd never used them prior to this point. I now believe that I've got a good grasp on the concept as well as the implementation. Because of this initial misunderstanding of flexbox I had some issues getting it to work in a way that I found satisfactory; the frustration from this lead to me not properly organizing my CSS in a thoughtful way. This, too, led to some frustration as debugging was made all the more difficult. Eventually I came to terms with the fact that I had to sit down and reformat my code, after which I was able to progress much more quickly.
